Examining the Extent of Inbreeding in Captive New England cottontail

# Background 
The New England cottontail is a species of conservation concern due to a population bottleneck and habitat fragmentation. A captive breeding program was put in place in 2011 in an attempt to rescue this species, but was largely unsuccessful. The initial goal of the program was to release around 250 kits back into wild populations each year, but only an average of 32 kits were released each year from 2011 to 2024. Since wild populations of New England cottontail have been shown to be inbreed, the goal of my project is to determine if inbreeding has an effect on fitness in the captive program. 

# Objectives
1. Examine the influence of inbreeding on fitness in the captive program
   A. Determine if there is a relationship between _kit_ individual inbreeding coefficient and weaning rate.
   B. Determine if there is a relationship between _parent_ individual inbreeding coefficient and the probability of birth, litter size, and kit weaning rate.
2. Determine if the distance between dam and sire trap locations is a predictor of reproductive fitness and relatedness (Figure 1).
3. Compare the utility of using microsatellite analysis and runs of homozygosity genomic data in estimating inbreeding.

Figure 2: The effect of kit inbreeding coefficient measured by internal relatedness on the probably of weaning. Data are collected from 167 New England cottontail kits (117 weaned and 50 unweaned) born in the captive breeding program between 2011 and 2024.

## Objectives 1B and 2

Figure 3: The effect of inbreeding in the New England cottontail captive breeding program on reproductive fitness measured at 3 stages: probability of birth (A, B, and C), litter size (D, E, and F), and weaning rate (G, H, and I). Inbreeding was measured by 3 metrics: dam individual inbreeding (A, D, and G), dam and sire pairwise relatedness (B, E, and H), and the distance between dam and sire trap locations (C, F, and I). In panels A-C, each point represents a dam-sire pairing; in panels D-I, each point represents a litter. Significant p values are lower than 0.05 and are written in red on the figures. Data were collected between 2011 and 2024.

Figure 5: Correlations between microsatellite-based estimates of inbreeding and runs of homozygosity-based estimates. A: a simple regression between FROH and internal relatedness. B: a simple regression between MLH and PHt. These data include New England cottontail kits and founders from the captive breeding program between 2011 and 2024.
